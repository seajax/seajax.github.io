Utilizing a 'saute-vent' ( French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5L V10 engine, gives the car a distinctly futuristic look. This is also to increase aerodynamicy. The rear view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or hide it when not in use. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer aided designs.

The car was produced between 1959 and 1961 by Maserati for racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance classic. It became famous for its intricate tubular space frame chassis, containing about 200 chro-moly steel tubes welded together, hence the nickname "Birdcage". This method of construction provided a more rigid and, at the same time, lighter chassis than other sports cars of the time. By recessing the windscreen base into the bodywork, Maserati was able to reduce the effect of new Le Mans rules demanding a tall windscreen. The Camoradi team became famous racing the Tipo 61's but, despite being faster round the track than other cars, the Birdcage was unreliable and often retired from races due to problems with the gearbox. The Maserati MC12 is available only in white and blue, to serve as a tribute to the Tipo 61 and the Camoradi racing team.</Description></Item><Item Id="185"><Description>The Mazda Furai is a concept car revealed on 27 December, 2007 and manufactured by Mazda.

Created partially in response to the state of the economy at the time and the resultant shrinkage of the high-end sports car market, the RX-01 undertook a back-to-basics approach of a compact, simple, fun-to-drive, yet inexpensive sports car much like the first generation RX-7. (By this time, the RX-7 had evolved into an uncompromising "super sports car" boasting ultra high performance with little creature comfort and a high price tag.) The RX-01 boasted a radical front end with a floating bumper/spoiler made possible by its compact rotary engine as well as a claimed true 2+2 seating arrangement. More significantly, however, it marked the first public appearance of the next generation of Mazda rotary engine design, the 13B-MSP. A naturally-aspirated engine, its exhaust ports are now located in the side housing instead of the periphery of the rotor housing, thus preventing overlapping intake and exhaust port timing. This has several benefits: higher output, improved thermal efficiency, better fuel economy, and cleaner emissions. While it was hoped by enthusiasts that the RX-01 would be put into production as the next iteration of Mazda's rotary sports car and made available to world markets (the RX-7 was discontinued in North America after 1995), the declining interest in sports car over SUVs and Mazda's financial state at the time conspired to keep RX-01 merely a concept car. However, the 13B-MSP would go on to be further developed into the eventual RENESIS engine that powers the RX-8.</Description></Item><Item Id="189"><Description>The Mazda Ryuga is a concept car introduced by Mazda and parent Ford Motor Company at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.
